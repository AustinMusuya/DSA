# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems while also exploring the inner workings of inbuilt data structures by implementing custom-built versions in various programming languages.

## 🔥 What This Repo Covers

- Solutions to DSA problems categorized by topic (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
- Custom implementations of fundamental data structures (linked lists, hashmaps, stacks, queues, etc.) to understand how built-in structures work under the hood.
- Solutions written in multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#.

## Why This Repo Exists

Many programming languages provide built-in data structures that abstract away complexity. However, understanding how these structures work internally can significantly improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency. This repository serves as a hands-on approach to mastering DSA by implementing key structures from scratch.
