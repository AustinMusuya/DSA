# Selection Sort

## Problem Statement

Implement the **Selection Sort** algorithm on an array of integers `nums`.

Return the sorted array in **ascending order**.

---

## Example

**Input:**  
`nums = [29, 10, 14, 37, 13]`

**Output:**  
`[10, 13, 14, 29, 37]`

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

---

## Approach

- Repeatedly select the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swap it into the correct position.

---

## Desired Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
