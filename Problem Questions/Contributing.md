# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this coding challenge repository!

This project contains categorized coding problems (by week and difficulty) with LeetCode-style markdown descriptions. Our goal is to provide clean, well-documented solutions in **multiple programming languages** for each problem.

---

## ✅ How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. Navigate to the week and problem you'd like to solve.
3. Inside the appropriate problem folder, create a new file with your solution, using the following naming convention:

```code
<problem-name>.<language-extension>
```

Example:

```code
reverse-array.py
reverse-array.js
reverse-array.cpp
```

4. Add a comment at the top of your file with:

- Your name or GitHub handle (optional)
- The programming language used
- Time and space complexity
- Brief explanation of your approach

5. Submit a **pull request** with a clear commit message.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

```code
📁 week-01-arrays-strings
├── 📁 easy
│ ├── reverse-array.md # Problem description
│ ├── reverse-array.py # Python solution
│ └── reverse-array.js # JavaScript solution
└── 📁 medium
└── ...
```

#### 📝 All problem descriptions are markdown files.

#### Code solutions can exist in **Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, Go, etc.**

## 💡 Best Practices

- Stick to readable, well-commented code.
- Include edge case handling.
- Follow standard naming conventions and formatting in your language.
- Avoid using unnecessary libraries unless the problem requires it.

## 🔍 Need Inspiration?

Check the `README.md` in each week's folder for the list of problems. Pick any one that doesn't already have a solution in your language—or improve an existing one with a better approach!
