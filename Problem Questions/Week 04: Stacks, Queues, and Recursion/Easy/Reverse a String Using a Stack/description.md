# Reverse String Using Stack

## Problem Statement

Given a string, reverse it using a stack. You must simulate the stack behavior explicitly.

---

## Example

**Input:**  
`s = "hello"`  
**Output:**  
`"olleh"`

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`

---

## Approach

- Push all characters to a stack.
- Pop characters to rebuild reversed string.

---

## Desired Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
